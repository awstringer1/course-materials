# Course Materials

This repository containts my (public) statistics course materials. Students may use it to see past tests and syllabi. It also forms the "Supplementary Materials" section of my Teaching Dossier.

This repository is created under the principle that, since all this stuff is released to students *at some point*, not making it organized and available publicly just disadvantages students who don't have friends who saved stuff, or some other means of obtaining it.

**Nothing in this repository is guaranteed to be correct, or reflective of the content or style of any future courses that I teach**.

This repository contains the following sections:

1. **Past syllabi**: syllabi for courses I have previously taught at the University of Toronto. Students who are deciding whether to take a course with me might find it helpful to have these.

1. **Past materials**: materials, including lecture slides and R code, for courses I have taught at the University of Toronto. I don't usually teach off slides anymore, I write on the blackboard and then show `R` code in class.

1. **Past tests**: if you're a student, this is probably why you're here...

1. **Links to other materials**: I have curated the following online resources:

  - **LEAF 2018 Course Materials Repository**: materials for Statistics instructors to use to integrate computation into their courses, [https://awstringer1.github.io/leaf2018/](https://awstringer1.github.io/leaf2018)

  - **STA238 Supplementary Materials**: a bookdown book where I implement most of the analyses and simulations from the course textbook for STA238, a course I co-developed at the University of Toronto. I also illustrate course concepts using large, messy, open datasets [https://awstringer1.github.io/sta238-book/](https://awstringer1.github.io/sta238-book/).

  - **Introductory R Workshop**: workshop materials I have created for our first-year students, to support an initiative from the Statistical Sciences student Union at the University of Toronto [https://awstringer1.github.io/ssu-r-workshop/](https://awstringer1.github.io/ssu-r-workshop/).
